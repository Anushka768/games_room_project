# games_room_project
A Python games project demonstrating functions, loops, randomization, and input/output handling.

## Games Included
- **Number Guess** – Guess the sum of two dice; score based on accuracy.
- **Modified RPSLS** – Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, with swapped rules for Spock and Lizard.
- **Coin Flip** – Flip a coin with scoring based on sequence rules.
- **Games Room** – Main program to play a series of games and track cumulative score.

## Concepts and Skills Demonstrated

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Functions & Modularity** | Each game is implemented as a separate function with clear parameters and returns. |
| **Randomization** | Uses `random.randint()` for dice rolls, coin flips, and bot moves. |
| **Loops** | `while` loops manage game repetition and cumulative scoring. |
| **Conditional Logic** | Extensive use of `if-elif-else` to evaluate outcomes. |
| **User Interaction** | Inputs from the player control gameplay and choices. |
| **Data Handling** | Uses variables and counters to manage points and flips. |
| **Input Validation** | Ensures valid move selections and error handling in MRPSLS. |

## How to Run
